# AIM
#--------

# Now time for some data engineering :)

# We want a dataset in which each row represents a patient and mutations of interests are columns. 
# However, mutations are currently manifested as rows in the mutations df. 

# The sample dataset is needed to link information together between the clinical df 
# and mutational df, see data relations information below for details. 

# IDEA: 
    
    # Define a list of genes of interest, place in other file.
    
    # Go through mutations df, keep only rows in which Hugo_Symbol matches a gene in list.
    
    # Transpose mutations df, keeping only columns of interest. 
    



# DATA RELATIONS BETWEEN TABLES:
#-----------------------------------------
# JOIN DATAFRAMES to single dataset
# CLINICAL DATA: PK = "PATIENT_ID"
# SAMPLE DATA: PK = "SAMPLE_ID", FK on Clinical = "PATIENT_ID"
# MUTATIONS DATA: FK on Sample = "Tumor_Sample_Barcode"


# COLUMNS OF INTEREST: 
#-----------------------
# CLINICAL DATA: 
# SAMPLE DATA: 
#MUTATIONS DATA: "Hugo_Symbol", "Consequence", "Variant_Type", and "Tumor_Sample_Barcode"



# WRITE FILES: Concatinated dataframes
