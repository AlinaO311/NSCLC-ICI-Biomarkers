For each folder of data: 

	Read patient clinical data file, get clinical data.

	Read patient sample data, get sample ID.

	Read mutations data, get mutation barcode. 

Join mutations to samples through tumor sample barcode. 
Join patients to samples through sample IDs. 


NOTE: Create two modes for wrapper, 
Can either preprocess, harmonize multiple...
OR can combine genetic data & clinical data from single... 

Script 1: Preprocess patient clinical data 
	- For each folder, read clinical data. 
	- Harmonise column names. 
	- Add study ID to each clinical table. 
	- Add PMID (from meta_study.txt) to clinical data table

Script 2: Join processed patient clinical data. 

Script 3: For each study, get genomic data of genes of interest.
